# Frisby

Some examples from Prof Frisby's functional programming course (https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript).

The presentation of the course is, er, odd, but content is very good indeed.

I've used unit tests mainly to execute the examples, so they're not meant to provide complete coverage and they may execute spurious (in terms of testing) code to illustrate/explore an example.
